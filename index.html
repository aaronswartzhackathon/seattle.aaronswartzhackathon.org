<h1>Aaron Swartz Hackathon</h1>
<img src="rip-aaron.jpg" />
<p>
Inspired by the work he did and the people he touched, we are organizing recurring hackathons at locations all over the world in memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>. The next set will be synchronized on the weekend of November 8-10, 2013. The event will bring together the varied communities that Aaron touched to figure out how the important problems of the world connect, and to share the load of working on those problems. 
The November 8-10 hackathon series is being coordinated on <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Worldwide_Aaron_Swartz_Memorial_Hackathon_Series">this wiki page</a>.
<h1>The Seattle Event</h1>
We will host the event at Jigsaw Renaissance:

<h2>Attending</h2>
If you'd like to attend (and we hope you do), you can of course just show up. To be in the loop for updates and with other attendees, please send a listserv request to <a href="mailto:seattle-subscribe@aaronswartzhackathon.org">the Seattle Mailing list</a>.
<h2>Other Logistics</h2>
Laptops are encouraged for for whom that is their tool. Pens, paper, soldering irons, knitting needles, and other bits are all highly encouraged. We'll have power to plug yourselves into and wireless.
We want people who express themselves through code, through art, through words, through anything at all. We want to hear your voice, and to add it to the chorus.
