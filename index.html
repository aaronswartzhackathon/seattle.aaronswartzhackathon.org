<h1>Aaron Swartz Hackathon</h1>
Inspired by the work he did and the people he touched, we are organizing recurring hackathons at locations all over the world in memory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a>. The next set will be synchronized on the weekend of November 8-10, 2013. The event will bring together the varied communities that Aaron touched to figure out how the important problems of the world connect, and to share the load of working on those problems. 
The November 8-10 hackathon series is being coordinated on <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Worldwide_Aaron_Swartz_Memorial_Hackathon_Series">this wiki pag</a>e.
<h1>The Boston Event</h1>
We are honored to host the event 19:00-23:00 Friday and 10:00-20:00 on the fifth floor of the MIT Media Lab. We feel the tension of being at MIT, while in the allied space of the Media Lab, will encourage participants to contribute to ongoing conversations of MIT's responsibility to its students, and to the awareness of academic and institutional issues.
<h2>Schedule</h2>
Friday will be dedicated to the exploration and examination of the Boston groups Aaron has touched. A few curated talks will lead the evening, with lots of time for breakout sessions for more in-depth examination of projects and communities.
<h2>Projects</h2>
Projects for all locations are listed on the <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Worldwide_Aaron_Swartz_Memorial_Hackathon_Series#Projects_to_Work_on">Planning wiki</a> , and the ones specifically happening in Boston are:
<ul>
<li><strong>tor2web and jot2tor</strong> : Tor2web makes it  possible for internet users to view content from Tor hidden services.  It's online in a (mostly) functioning form at http://tor2web.org . Jot2tor is an extension of this allowing users to use Aaron's  jottit.com framework to easily create pages hosted on hidden services.  Naturally, pages created via jot2tor are accessible from tor2web. Aaron  and I actually worked on both of these projects until his death.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Project lead : Oliver</li>
    <li>Useful skills : </li>
    </ul>
<li><strong>Hal Report TL; DR</strong> : The report around MIT's involvement with Aaron's case is long and covoluted. We'd like to parse it out in ways that make more sense and give opportunity for people associated with MIT to take action.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Project lead : </li>
    <li>Useful skills : Wordsmithing, close reading, information visualization, research</li>
    </ul>
