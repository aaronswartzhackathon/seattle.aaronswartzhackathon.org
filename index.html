<p class="big"><a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Seattle/events/146815212/">SIGN UP HERE!</a></p>
<p class="p6"><b>Come hack!</b></p>
<p class="p4">Everyone is welcome to show up and work on projects. We value social justice, legal and tech backgrounds equally -- there will be interesting work for everyone.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4">If you have a project you'd like to work on, you're welcome to show up anytime. For best results, show up on Friday night and talk about what you're working on for a few minutes. Send email to [Aaron Swartz Mailing List] and we'll include a project description on this page. We're especially interested in projects which target privacy, access to information, community justice and open data.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4">To be in the loop for updates and connect with other attendees, please send a listserv request to <a href="mailto:seattle-subscribe@aaronswartzhackathon.org"><span class="s1">the Seattle Mailing list</span></a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Seattle/events/146815212/">register on meetup</a>. Drop-ins welcome or RSVP to the list and tell us a little bit about what you're excited to work on.</p>
<p class="p8"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>What should I bring?</b></p>
<p class="p4">Bring a laptop if you use one. Pens, paper, soldering irons, and knitting needles are also encouraged. We'll have power and a wireless connection. There may even be delicious food.

Black Coffee Co-op, located in Capitol Hill at 501 E Pine Street, has generously donated coffee for the event. Visit their website at: <a href="http://blackcoffeecoop.com"></a></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4">We want people who express themselves through code, through art, through words, through anything at all. Interpretive dances will be restricted to the break room.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p6"><b>What kinds of projects will be there?</b></p>
<p class="p4"><b>h0tb0x: </b>Open-source infrastructure for sharing data with friends. Golang and web hackers welcome.</p>
<p class="p7"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>SeaCOP open data: </b>The Seattle Center for Open Policing will be here with data obtained through public records requests. We're currently working on a public interface so that all citizens can access this information. Web developers, user experience experts, and curious nerds encouraged.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Tor node: </b>Snakes on a Tor was brought as a hackathon project. Folks are setting up relays and bridges on fresh nodes and educating each other about Tor strategery. We switched over to hacking on OONI, the Open Observatory of Network Interference, as it is relatively up-to-date and maintained. The goal is to bring back Tor tools which identify bad actors who either change or drop responses.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>FOIA club: </b>We're interested in free educational outreach in Seattle to teach folks how to navigate state and federal public records laws. We've put together a training presentation and taught each other a thing or two. Legal-minded people and activists welcome.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>RECAP/PACER: </b>We're porting RECAP, a tool for downloading and sharing legal documents, to Internet Explorer, as enough people in the legal field use Windows to justify this silliness.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>LEAP Encryption Access Protocol:</b>Working to create a set of high-security communication tools that are reliable and easy to use.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Security challenges -- hosting:</b>Support for crowd-submitted CTF-style puzzles in sandboxed environments. Progress was made, no maintainers will be available on Sunday.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Occupy Sandy:</b>Front-end development for disaster response project management tool. Uses kanban. Progress made and maintainers will be available tomorrow.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>FreeGeek Seattle:</b>Secure and scalable donation inventory management. Inventory framework and front-end.</p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Your project: </b>Everyone is welcome to show up with a project and solicit help.</p>
